# Eyes Recognizer
This repository contains a project that recognize human eyes
and was used as project base for my graduation final project.

## Graduation Project
I use my final project on Computer Engineering Course, to 
develop a prototype of a software that could help other people.

With this base project I could recognize the human eyes and implement 
a basic psychological test, that helped psychologists conduct tests 
on people with motor disabilities.
